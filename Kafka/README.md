# Zookeeper
## How do the Kafka brokers and clients keep track of all the Kafka brokers if there is more than one? 
- The Kafka team decided to use Zookeeper for this purpose.
- Zookeeper is used for metadata management in the Kafka world. For example:
    - Zookeeper keeps track of which brokers are part of the Kafka cluster
    - Zookeeper is used by Kafka brokers to determine which broker is the leader of a given partition and topic and perform leader elections
    - Zookeeper stores configurations for topics and permissions
    - Zookeeper sends notifications to Kafka in case of changes (e.g. new topic, broker dies, broker comes up, delete topics, etc.â€¦)
- port: 2181:2181
